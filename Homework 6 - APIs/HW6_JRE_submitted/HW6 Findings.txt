Homework 6 - Weather API

What's the weather like as we approach the equator?
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

Based on the charts I created:
1. City Latitude vs. Max Temperature:
   - there is a slight correlation - being closer to the equator does result in highr temperatures
2. City Latitude vs. Humidity:
   - no significant relationship between the two
   - many cities have high humidity (close to the sea?)
3. City Latitude vs. Cloudiness:
   - no significant relationship between the two
   - cloudiness seems to be assigned in an arbitrary fashion (10,20, 40, etc.)
4. City Latitude vs. Wind Speed:
   - very little range in wind speed
   - no significant relationship between the two
