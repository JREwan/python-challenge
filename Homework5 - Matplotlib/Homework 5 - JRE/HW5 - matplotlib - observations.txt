Observations about the data
1. Urban settings generate more rides, but at lower average fare; Rural is the opposite
2. Suburban drivers produce more fares / driver than do urban drivers
3. Rural markets produce the most revenue / driver - a possible area for growing revenue
Editorial comments
4.  This assignment was much more reasonable than HW4. I was able to get the assignment
    done and have time to review some of may many python deficiencies / weaknesses
5.  I feel like this homework did improve my python skills
6.  Thanks again to Stack Overflow & google!
